National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University was created in 2021 through the merger of two universities: National Yang-Ming University and 
National Chiao Tung University.

Yang Ming, which focused on biomedical research, and Chiao Tung, which focused on electronic communication research, were both top-tier 
universities in Taiwan. At present, there are 19 colleges and 74 university/college-level research centers. Faculties include: 
artificial intelligence and green energy, biological science and technology, computer science, dentistry, humanity and social science, 
Hakka studies, law, life sciences, medicine, nursing, management and general education.

To supplement medical studies, there’s also a university hospital based in Yilan, which offers practical teaching experience within 
various departments outside of the classroom.

On campus, students will find student dormitories, libraries, laboratories, seminar rooms, conference rooms and offices.
 
For students with an interest in sport, there are comprehensive sports facilities, which include a gymnasium, hilltop stadium, surface 
stadium and a swimming pool. In the gymnasium, there is a multipurpose court, an aerobics room, a table tennis room, a weight-training 
room, and a cardiopulmonary room. The multipurpose court can be used for basketball, volleyball, table tennis, and badminton. There’s 
also a 400m track field.
 
There’s also the National Yang-Ming Chiao Tung University Arts Centre, which was established in 2021. It combines artistic activities 
and resources accumulated over the years from students. The center also organizes and encourages a variety of artistic activities on 
campus, including exhibitions, art performances, workshops, public lectures of distinguished speakers, and literary and photography 
awards.
